I Love My Sweet Armenia's...
I love my sweey Armenia's word which is filled with the taste of sun,
I love our old lyre's melody from its mournful and weeping strings,
The vivacious fragrance of the blood like flowers and the roses, 
I lov as well the graceful and agile dance of Nayirian girls.
I love as well our gloomy sky, our pure waters,, luminous lake,
The summer's sun and the winter's sublime wind with a dragon's voice,
Also the black, unwelcoming walls of the huts lost in the dark,
And I love the thousand year stone of the ancient cities as well.

No matter where I am yet I shall not forget our mournful songs,
Shall not forget our steel lettered books which now have become prayers,
No matter how sharply they pierce my heart our wounds so soaked with blood,
Even then I love my orphaned and my bloodied, dear Armenia.

for my longing heart there is not, not even one tale
