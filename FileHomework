I Love My Sweet Armenia's...
I love my sweey Armenia's word which is filled with the taste of sun,
I love our old lyre's melody from its mournful and weeping strings,
The vivacious fragrance of the blood like flowers and the roses, 
I lov as well the graceful and agile dance of Nayirian girls.
I love as well our gloomy sky, our pure waters,, luminous lake,
The summer's sun and the winter's sublime wind with a dragon's voice,
Also the black, unwelcoming walls of the huts lost in the dark,
And I love the thousand year stone of the ancient cities as well.
